**InsightPredictor** is a structured machine learning pipeline focused on regression-based prediction using synthetic data. It simulates a real-world AI development workflow — including data generation, training, evaluation, and prediction — backed by version-controlled contributions with accurate historical context.

This project was created and is maintained by **Ego Joseph**. It is open-source and welcomes public contributions to enhance its scope, features, and practical applications.
